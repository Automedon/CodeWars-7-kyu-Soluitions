/*
Description:
Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string.

A has an index of 0,
E has an index of 1,

I has an index of 2,

O has an index of 3,

U has an index of 4.

Example: "John Doe hs 7 red pples under his bsket" => "0";

Example: "Bb Smith sent us six neatly arranged range bicycles" => "3";

There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowles but one. (Also, you won't need to worry about capitals)

   if (!x.match(/i/)) return 2
    if (!x.match(/o/)) return 3
     if (!x.match(/u/)) return 4
